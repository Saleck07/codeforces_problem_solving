# 🧠 Codeforces Problem Solving by SaleckAmeine

Welcome to my Codeforces problem-solving repository!

This project is a collection of solutions I’ve written while practicing and improving my competitive programming skills,
mainly on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).
It also helps me keep track of my **progression, learning path**, and **algorithmic improvement** over time.
